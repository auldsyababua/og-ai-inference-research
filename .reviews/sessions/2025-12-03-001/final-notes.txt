Phase 2 implementation approved after two review rounds. All feedback addressed:
- Critical: Enhanced DROP + CREATE documentation
- Major: Clarified environment.yml detection at stage root
- Minor: Improved error handling, added version justification, updated rollback warnings
Ready for deployment when maintenance window is scheduled.
