  "summary": "Phase 2 implementation: Automated Snowflake Streamlit package management via environment.yml with DROP + CREATE workflow to resolve matplotlib ModuleNotFoundError. Changes include:\n\n1. Created tools/environment.yml with pinned versions (streamlit=1.35.0, matplotlib=3.10.6, seaborn=0.13.2)\n2. Updated deploy_to_snowflake_streamlit.py to:\n   - Upload environment.yml to stage\n   - Implement DROP + CREATE pattern (replaces CREATE OR REPLACE) - required because Snowflake only copies files once\n   - Add deployment verification (checks app exists, verifies stage files)\n   - Enhanced output messaging\n3. Created comprehensive deployment guide (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_PHASE2.md) with pre-deployment checklist, rollback procedures, and troubleshooting\n\nThis implements Phase 2 of the RAEP investigation (.scratch/raep-debug/02-snowflake-matplotlib-import/10-handoff.md). Phase 1 (UI-based package addition) was completed by user.",

    "Verify DROP + CREATE logic is correct and safe",

    "Review deployment verification logic for completeness",
    "Ensure rollback procedures are clear and actionable",
    "Validate error handling in deployment script"
