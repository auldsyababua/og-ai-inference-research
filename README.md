# Off-Grid AI Inference Research

## Overview
Technical and economic modeling for GPU compute infrastructure powered by off-grid natural gas generation.

**Project Goal:** Model both financially and technically how to deploy AI inference workloads using stranded natural gas as the primary power source.

## Quick Start

1. **Understand the project:** Read `docs/PRD.md`
2. **Review current state:** Check `STATUS.md`
3. **See what's missing:** Review `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
4. **Use the calculator:** Open `models/generator-risk-calculator/`

## Key Documents

- **PRD:** Product Requirements Document - defines calculator scope
- **Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing data and parameters
- **Generator Library:** Caterpillar natural gas generator specifications
- **Calculator:** Risk assessment tool for GPU-generator compatibility

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundation
**Focus:** Caterpillar generator library, basic risk calculator, gap analysis

See `STATUS.md` for detailed progress tracking.
